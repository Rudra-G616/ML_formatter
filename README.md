# ML_formatter <br> 
The main aim is to format poorly formatted rst files by using a neural network. So first we will have some properly formatted rst files. Then we will add mistakes into those via a code to create training data. Then we will train a neural network on this training data. Also evaluate the model and finally make predictions on the actual file.
